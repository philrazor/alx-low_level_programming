This repository contains C programs that includes the following files:

* `0-reset_to_98.c`
* `1-swap.c`
* `2-strlen.c`
* `3-puts.c`
* `4-print_rev.c`
* `5-rev_string.c`
* `6-puts2.c`
* `7-puts_half.c`
* `8-print_array.c`
* `9-strcpy.c`
* `100-main.c`

## Requirements
These programs were written in `C` programming language. To compile and run them you need to have `gcc` compiler installed in your computer.

## How to compile
Use `gcc` command followed by the file name you want to compile. For example, to compile `0-reset_to_98.c`:
```

## How to run
Once you have compiled the file, you can run the program using `./` followed by the name of executable file. For example, to run `0-reset_to_98.c`:
```
./reset
``` 

## File descriptions

### 0-reset_to_98.c
This program takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to `98`.

### 1-swap.c
This program swaps the values of two integers.

### 2-strlen.c
This program computes and returns the length of a string.

### 3-puts.c
This program prints a string on the standard output followed by a newline.

### 4-print_rev.c
This program prints the reverse of a string.

### 5-rev_string.c
This program reverses a string.

### 6-puts2.c
This program prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.

### 7-puts_half.c
This program prints the second half of a string.

### 8-print_array.c
This program prints an array of integers.

### 9-strcpy.c
This program copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte `\0`, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

### 100-main.c
This program contains the main function for testing the other programs.
